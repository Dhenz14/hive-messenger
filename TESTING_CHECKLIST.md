## Edge Case Tests

### 🔧 Test 6: Missing Encrypted Content
**Steps:**
1. Check IndexedDB for old messages without `encryptedContent`
2. Try to decrypt them
3. **Expected:** Decrypt button may not work OR shows error
4. **Note:** This is expected for old data

### 🔧 Test 7: Corrupted Message Auto-Fix
**Steps:**
1. If you have messages showing base64-like content (corrupted)
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected:** Corruption detection fixes them automatically
4. **Expected:** Messages show encrypted placeholder
5. **Expected:** Can decrypt if encryptedContent exists

### 🔧 Test 8: Multiple Conversations
**Steps:**
1. Send messages to 3+ different users
2. Decrypt some messages in each conversation
3. Switch between conversations
4. **Expected:** Each conversation remembers which messages are decrypted
5. **Expected:** Query invalidation works per-conversation

## Known Limitations

### ❌ Old Sent Messages (Before This Fix)
- **Issue:** Messages sent before this update were stored WITHOUT encrypted content
- **Impact:** You cannot decrypt old sent messages you've already sent
- **Workaround:** All NEW sent messages will be decryptable
- **Reason:** Old confirmMessage() didn't store encryptedContent

### ✅ Old Received Messages
- **Impact:** All received messages (old and new) can be decrypted
- **Reason:** Encrypted content fetched from blockchain

---

## Quick Verification Script

```javascript
// Run in browser console to check IndexedDB structure
const req = indexedDB.open('hive-messenger-v3');
req.onsuccess = function() {
  const db = req.result;
  const tx = db.transaction('messages', 'readonly');
  const store = tx.objectStore('messages');
  const getAllReq = store.getAll();
  
  getAllReq.onsuccess = function() {
    const messages = getAllReq.result;
    console.log('Total messages:', messages.length);
    
    const withEncrypted = messages.filter(m => m.encryptedContent);
    console.log('Messages with encryptedContent:', withEncrypted.length);
    
    const sent = messages.filter(m => m.from === 'YOUR_USERNAME');
    console.log('Sent messages:', sent.length);
    
    const sentWithEncrypted = sent.filter(m => m.encryptedContent);
    console.log('Sent messages with encryptedContent:', sentWithEncrypted.length);
    
    // Show sample message structure
    if (messages.length > 0) {
      console.log('Sample message:', {
        id: messages[0].id,
        from: messages[0].from,
        to: messages[0].to,
        contentPreview: messages[0].content.substring(0, 50),
        hasEncryptedContent: !!messages[0].encryptedContent,
        encryptedContentPreview: messages[0].encryptedContent?.substring(0, 50)
      });
    }
  };
};
```
